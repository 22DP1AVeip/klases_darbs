Raised by his single mother, Gloria James, in a neighborhood plagued by crime and poverty, LeBron's early life wasn't easy. They frequently moved from apartment to apartment, but his love for basketball was evident from a young age.
            LeBron attended St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, where his basketball skills quickly made him a national sensation. By his sophomore year, he was already dominating high school courts, and his games were drawing large crowds. He led his high school team to three state championships in four years and was named to the USA Today All-USA First Team as a sophomore, an honor usually reserved for college players.
            In 2002, LeBron’s talent earned him the cover of Sports Illustrated, with the headline "The Chosen One," making him a household name before even entering college. This immense pressure only fueled his drive, and by his senior year, he was considered the best high school basketball player in the country.
